<a id="docs-requirements"></a>
## Requirements

#### Laravel 5
* PHP: >= 7.x
* Guzzle >= 6.0

<a id="docs-configuration"></a>
## Configuration

#### Composer

First, add the Simple SMS package to your `require` in your `composer/json` file:

    "require": {
        "simplesoftwareio/simple-sms": "3.1.*"
    }

Next, run the `composer update` command.  This will install the package into your Laravel application.

#### Service Provider

Once you have added the package to your composer file, you will need to register the service provider with Laravel.

Add `SimpleSoftwareIO\SMS\SMSServiceProvider::class` in your `config/app.php` configuration file within the `providers` array.

#### Aliases

Finally, register the Facade.

Add `'SMS' => SimpleSoftwareIO\SMS\Facades\SMS::class` in your `config/app.php` configuration file within the `aliases` array.

#### API Settings

You must run the following command to save your configuration files to your local app:

    php artisan vendor:publish

This will copy the configuration files to your `config` folder.

#### Driver Configuration

<a id="docs-call-fire-driver"></a>
###### Call Fire Driver

This driver sends and receives all messages through the [Call Fire](https://www.callfire.com/) service.  It is a very quick and reliable service provider that includes many features such as drip campaigns and voice services.

Fill in the `config` file with the correct settings to use this driver.  You can find these settings under your CallFire account and then selecting [API Access.](https://www.callfire.com/ui/manage/access)

    return [
        'driver' => 'callfire',
        'from' => 'Not Use For Call Fire',
        'callfire' => [
            'app_login' => 'Your App Login',
            'app_password' => 'Your App Password'
        ],
    ];

>Note: All messages from CallFire come from the same short number (67076)

<a id="docs-e-mail-driver"></a>
###### E-mail Driver

The E-Mail driver sends all messages through the configured e-mail driver for Laravel.  This driver uses the wireless carrier's e-mail gateways to send SMS messages to mobile phones. The biggest benefit to using the e-mail driver is that it is completely free to use.

The only setting for this driver is the `from` setting.  Simply enter an email address that you would like to send messages from.

    return [
        'driver' => 'email',
        'from' => 'example@example.com',
    ];

>If messages are not being sent, ensure that you are able to send E-Mail through Laravel first.

The following are currently supported by using the e-mail gateway driver.

| Country | Carrier | Carrier Prefix | SMS Supported | MMS Supported |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| USA | AT&T | att | Yes | Yes |

<a id="docs-usage"></a>
## Usage

#### Basic Usage

Simple SMS operates in much of the same way as the Laravel Mail service provider.  If you are familiar with this then SMS should feel like home.  The most basic way to send a SMS is to use the following:

    //Service Providers Example
    SMS::send('Your SMS Message', null, function($sms) {
        $sms->to('+15555555555');
    });

    //Service Providers Using A Laravel View
    //$data is the information that will be passed onto the view file.
    SMS::send('laravel::viewFile', $data, function($sms) {
        $sms->to('+15555555555');
    });

    //Email Driver Example
    SMS::send('Your SMS Message', null, function($sms) {
        $sms->to('+15555555555', 'att');
    });

The first parameter is the view file that you would like to use.  The second is the data that you wish to pass to the view.  The final parameter is a callback that will set all of the options on the `message` closure.

#### Send

The `send` method sends the SMS through the configured driver using a Laravel view file.

    SMS::send($view, Array $data, function($sms) {
        $sms->to('+15555555555');
    }
    SMS::send('laravel::view', $data, function($sms) {
        $sms->to('+15555555555');
    });

It is possible to send a simple message without creating views by passing a string instead of a view.

    SMS::send($message, [], function($sms) {
        $sms->to('+15555555555');
    }
    SMS::send('This is my message', [], function($sms) {
        $sms->to('+15555555555');
    });

#### Driver

The `driver` method will switch the provider during runtime.

    //Will send through default provider set in the config file.
    SMS::queue('Your SMS Message', $data, function($sms) {
        $sms->to('+15555555555');
    });

    SMS::driver('twilio');

    //Will send through Twilio
    SMS::queue('Your SMS Message', $data, function($sms) {
        $sms->to('+15555555555');
    });

#### Queue

The `queue` method queues a message to be sent later instead of sending the message instantly.  This allows for faster respond times for the consumer by offloading uncustomary processing time. Like `Laravel's Mail` system, queue also has `queueOn,` `later,` and `laterOn` methods.

    SMS::queue('Your SMS Message', $data, function($sms) {
        $sms->to('+15555555555');
    });

>The `queue` method will fallback to the `send` method if a queue service is not configured within `Laravel.`

#### Receive

Simple SMS supports push SMS messages.  You must first configure this with your service provider by following the configuration settings above.

    Route::post('sms/receive', function()
    {
        SMS::receive();
    }

The receive method will return a `IncomingMessage` instance.  You may request any data off of this instance like:

    Route::post('sms/receive', function()
    {
        $incoming = SMS::receive();
        //Get the sender's number.
        $incoming->from();
        //Get the message sent.
        $incoming->message();
        //Get the to unique ID of the message
        $incoming->id();
        //Get the phone number the message was sent to
        $incoming->to();
        //Get the raw message
        $incoming->raw();
    }

The `raw` method returns all of the data that a driver supports.  This can be useful to get information that only certain service providers provide.

    Route::post('sms/receive', function()
    {
        $incoming = SMS::receive();
        //Twilio message status
        echo $incoming->raw()['status'];
    }

The above would return the status of the message on the Twilio driver.

>Data used from the `raw` method will not work on other service providers.  Each provider has different values that are sent out with each request.

#### Check Messages

This method will retrieve an array of messages from the service provider.  Each message within the array will be an `IncomingMessage` object.

    $messages = SMS::checkMessages();
    foreach ($messages as $message)
    {
        //Will display the message of each retrieve message.
        echo $message->message();
    }

The `checkMessages` method supports has an `options` variable to pass some settings onto each service provider. See each service providers API to see which `options` may be passed.

More information about each service provider can be found at their API docs.

#### Get Message

You are able to retrieve a message by it's ID with a simply call.  This will return an IncomingMessage object.

    $message = SMS::getMessage('aMessageId');
    //Prints who the message came from.
    echo $message->from();

<a id="docs-outgoing-enclosure"></a>
## Outgoing Message

#### To

The `to` method adds a phone number that will have a message sent to it.

    //Service Provider Example
    SMS::send('Your SMS Message', $data, function($sms) {
        $sms->to('+15555555555');
        $sms->to('+14444444444');
    });

>The carrier is required for the email driver so that the correct email gateway can be used.  See the table above for a list of accepted carriers.

#### From

The `from` method will set the address from which the message is being sent.

    SMS::send('Your SMS Message', $data, function($sms) {
        $sms->from('+15555555555');
    });

#### attachImage

The `attachImage` method will add an image to the message.  This will also convert the message to a MMS because SMS does not support image attachments.

    //Service Provider Driver
    SMS::send('Your SMS Message', $data, function($sms) {
        $sms->attachImage('/url/to/image.jpg');
    });

>Currently only supported with the E-Mail and Twilio Driver.

<a id="docs-incoming-message"></a>
## Incoming Message

All incoming messages generate a `IncomingMessage` object.  This makes it easy to retrieve information from them in a uniformed way across multiple service providers.

#### Raw

The `raw` method returns the raw data provided by a service provider.

    $incoming = SMS::getMessage('messageId');
    echo $incoming->raw()['status'];

>Each service provider has different information in which they supply in their requests.  See their documentations API for information on what you can get from a `raw` request.

#### From

This method returns the phone number in which a message came from.

    $incoming = SMS::getMessage('messageId');
    echo $incoming->from();

#### To

The `to` method returns the phone number that a message was sent to.

    $incoming = SMS::getMessage('messageId');
    echo $incoming->to();
